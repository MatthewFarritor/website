                I will try to start keeping a log of what I do and this is my first entry! This is just for myself but I thought it would be cool to have it on my website. 
                 Today I worked on making the bird art project (see projects page(I have not made a bird entry yet)) 
                 I worked for 30ish min and then found out my plan won't work so I am going to try again tomorrow.
                  I also am 3d printing a model small of a Falcon 9. 
                I read a chapter of Dr space and a chapter of For Whom the Bell Tolls.
