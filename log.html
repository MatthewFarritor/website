        <h5>I finished my Falcon 9 model. It could use a better paint job but this was a good first go. 
            My dad wants me to make a second one for him and I am also going to print a Saturn 1b model. I don't know how to display them because they can't stand free. 
            I might make a stand so they can lie on their side but I don't know. I kept working on the wooden frames and wooden spatula. I also got a retropie working on pi zero.
             I am going to make a portable emulator but I do not know if I will make it or will try to put it in an NES controller. It would be very cool in an NES controller but I don't know if you would do video.
              Having a big cable come out of it would ruin the magic. I think I will make a portable emulator from scratch and do the NES in an NES controller later. 
              I don't know how to upload a ROM to the SD card but I will figure that out tomorrow because I am trying to go to bed earlier. I am also still stuck on the bird wing problem which I will also try tomorrow.
               I also am going to write some random thoughts here in the future, not just what I got done. Maybe movie reviews or something. I am also thinking I need to start a blog just so I start writing outside of school. 
               ideas; was Napoleon a hero or villain or why does he get so much glory (Maybe he doesn't get as much as I think. I don't know) I also am thinking about supplementary feeding elk on elk refuge in Wyoming.
                Reason for and against it or something like that. (I stole that from Luke) also need to fix the marden when you look at this page on your phone. 
                And I need to write i bio and add a pick and pages to the projects page.
             This is probably full of runs-ons and other mistakes but it felt nice to write.

            <h5>
                I will try to start keeping a log of what I do and this is my first entry! 
                This is just for myself but I thought it would be cool to have it on my website.  Today I worked on making the bird art project (see projects page(I have not made a bird entry yet))
                 I worked for 30ish min and then found out my plan won't work, so I am going to try again tomorrow. 
                 I also am 3d printing a small model of a Falcon 9. 
                 I read a chapter of Dr space and a chapter of For Whom the Bell Tolls. 
                I also got the margins to work correctly on this page, which took me much longer than I am willing to admit.
